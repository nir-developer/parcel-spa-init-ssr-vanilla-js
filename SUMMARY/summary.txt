Separate the js code - put js files in the src , and other assets in the public folder 


KEY NOTES:

    PARCEL PRODUCTION MODE VS DEVELOPMENT MODE
----------------------------------
       -  RUNNING PARCEL DEVELOPMENT MODE:
                
                -  npm start 
                - (or parcel public/index.html)

            KEY NOTES:

                - Parcel will not write output to disk , instead it serves 
                 the compiled assets directlry from memory . 
                 This approach speed up the Development and supports HMR - whithout generating physical files! 
                 Parcel will handles the bundling and serves the compiled assets through it's dev sever

            


        PRODUCTION MODE: 

            - npm run build
            - (or parcel build public/index/html) 

        When building the project for production , Parcel compiles and optimize my 
        app into the dist directory by default! GENERATE PHYSICAL FILES 

       - Running PARCEL in PRODUCTION MODE: 
                
                -npm run build 
                - (or parcel build public/index.html)

        
        - By deault Parcel will compile the application into the dist folder! 
          IN BOTH CASES - but the bundlers will be different

    1. Serving Static Assets: Production vs Development
----------------------------------------------------------------
     - In production(NODE_ENV === 'production')
            - serves static files(like CSS, js, images) 
               from client/dist directory using express.static  
     
     - In Development : 
            - For all requests (*) , routes them to the index.html file in the client dist directory
     EXPLANATION: 
     ESSENTIAL TO FOR DELIVERING ASSETS THAT DONT NEED TO BE DYNAMICALLY GENERATED FOR EACH REQUEST
